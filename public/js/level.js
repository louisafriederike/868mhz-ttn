Every time I looked down at my arms and hands, I saw those of a stranger, limp and disconnected body parts hanging from my torso. But in this mirror world, I am floating, intuitively, never doubting that the path in front was intended for me. Two interlaced grids sharing the same spatial markers.

Lifetimes, turning into fractures of moments as I blink my eyes open. Memory represents space in this world, and the processor is time. A simple organizing principle. I walk through this world, uncovering layers of information in bits. My memory builds places on top of coordinates, stacking information and emotion onto the spatial grid. My subconscious will spend night after night constructing dungeons and palaces from badly processed memories, for me to revisit endlessly. So here I am again.
