            EtherAxis is an interactive game installation and reflection tool aiming to challenge the inner paradigms that shape our perception of realities. The physical relic that forms the base for this game shape-shifts in different contexts.
            <br><br>The structure of the gameboard emphasises four main axes, each connected to multiple ancient symbols of alchemy, hacked to uncover their original meanings. In this constellation of four interlaced geographic grids, the dreamer wanders through bridging fields on a spatiotemporal axis. Throughout the Overkill, EtherAxis lures you into the streets to find its messages hidden in plain sight, stepping over to the worlds floating in the ether.‚Äç
            <br><br>EtherAxis is the result of an ongoing collaboration between Camilo Garc√≠a A., Emilia Tapprest, Erik Peters, Federico Poni, Louisa Teichmann & Victor Evink, as part of the Hamburger Community of Live & Art trajectory of Roodkapje. With the participation of Queer Arcana as performers.

            Something is rising in the midst of the city surrounding us. In between the many microcosms of the infinitely unfinished city of Rotterdam, three potential futures are emerging in the nebulous atmosphere. A city mirroring a constant construction site opens up doorways to realities close enough to sense. The realities of the year 2041.
            <br><br>In a game of chance, players are led to a series of geographical locations, to try and unlock artefacts of the societies of Zhouw√©i Network. In the form of an ephemeral soundscape, EARTHRISE infiltrates your perception of the changing sceneries you find yourself in as you follow the directions of the game makers. As you surrender to the game, your destined path will unravel before you. Do you feel at home in your own reality? What about the one you are moving towards?
            <br><br>      
            On Zhouw√©i NETWORK
            <br>
            Zhouw√©i Network is a worldbuilding research umbrella that explores the design of affective undertones in different speculative future societies, in dialogue with currently emerging technocultural developments. The fiction series ‚ÄòEmbodied ambitopias‚Äô (2021) zooms in on hypothetical mind-body exercises, combined with speculative interfaces and contrasting rhetorics to shed light on the differences, as well as the occasional similarities, between the three worlds.
            <br> 
            Liminal Vision is a creative collaboration between Victor Evink (s x m b r a) and Emilia Tapprest (nvisible.studio). Their project Zhouw√©i Network is currently showcased at Zero Emissions by 2099, in MAMA, curated by Mary Ponomareva.
            <br><br>With artistic contributions by Gill Baldwin, Camilo Garc√≠a A. & Federico Poni. Directed by Louisa Teichmann and co-produced with Erik Peters & Ruta Genyte in collaboration with Mary Ponomareva and Roodkapje as part of their ‚ÄúAgency & Machine‚Äù program.

         <p class="project-text">
            Ultimate Dragon is an adventure game which lures you in with a
            promise: your personalised utopia. As you move through the fictional landscape in constant dialogue with the programme, your
            input generates a 3-dimensional digital landscape hidden behind
            its interface. The programme secretly constructs a world based
            on your activity in the game.<br><br>
            Every time the player is making a choice within the game, another layer is stacked onto their virtual terrain. This results in
            a feedback loop, depending on constant input from both sides of
            the screen. As soon as enough information has been stored, the
            personal landscape is revealed. Can the programme‚Äôs creation
            compare to the world the player imagined based on the writing?
            Is technology able to translate their fiction into a liveable digital
            environment and if not, whose fiction is it?<br><br>
            The text adventure is the grandfather of computer gaming,
            reaching straight into the player‚Äôs imagination, as their fantasy
            slowly unfolds within an interactive landscape. This role-playing
            game of depending on a mediator between the player and their
            desired information has expanded into a permanent interface
            over the years, limiting the users to a set of premade choices
            and paths.<br><br>
            These choices reflect in their digital environment, as their activity is being interpreted and fed back to them. Technology is giving us a hand with distorting our perceived reality and we grip it tightly. We are facing a new, gamified reality covering the means of its construction behind opaque interfaces. A personalised environment compromising your idealistic vision into its digitised representation.

            I Am the Dungeon Master is an experimental multi-media escape game inspired by the table-top game Dungeons & Dragons. By making use of interactive chatrooms, players are able to co-write the storyline through the use of the different media in the room. Simulating a digital text-based game, so called Multi-User Dungeon or MUD, which were on the rise in the early ninetees, this interactive installation aims to visualise the basic structure and workings of virtual environments in a playful manner.

            Who are you when the lights go off? A better, more honest version of yourself, or do you feel tempted to embody a different person entirely? During Digital Masquerade, we explored the freedom of anonymity in a physical chatroom.
            After "logging in" (by putting on a mask with an image of choice clipped to it) visitors joined an online chat on their phones, entering a darkened room with two large projections on the wall. One of them being the anonymous live chat, the other one being a livestream to an online game which showed a realistic simulation of the room. The simulation was filled with eccentric avatars of gamers who were joining the chat discussion and following the course of the evening through a livestream simultaneously.
            Confronted with a statement on identity by Cyborgs rights activist <a href="https://ar.al/2018/06/20/digital-masquerade/" target="__blank">Aral Balkan</a> and a preview of a film on identification technology by <a href='https://www.robertglas.nl/#2020' target="__blank">Robert Glas</a>, visitors in both realities were commenting and discussing anonymously in the joined chat. No speaking, just staring at phones and screens, typing, reading and occasionally chuckling at a comment. Digital means of communication fused with a physical setting blurred the lines between reality and virtuality.<br><br>The experimental band <a href="https://youtu.be/YKUMlkVSnMQ">OptionY</a> was performing in-game, filling the room with peculiar sounds and visuals. The host of the evening was a computer-generated voice, which read out parts of the chat discussion throughout the night, highlighting the clash of banal comments with complex thoughts on identity.
